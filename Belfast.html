        <p>Belfast, Northern Ireland was a bit sketchy, as advertized. 
        As I carried my huge check-bag over the top of my head and shoulders toward my hostel,
            I was approached by a man on the street. He began to tell me about
            how his mother was in the hospital and he needed some money to make a phone call. "I'm sorry, but I don't have any cash," I told him. "A card will work," he replied, "there is an ATM right around the corner." I apologized, and told the man I couldn't help him. "F$%# you then," he said, and stormed away.<br><br>
            While in Belfast, I met a bunch of cool people from all over the world, and I began to feel more confident in puting myself out there. For one day, I took a Game of Thrones tour, which took us to some really amazing places. At one point, I walked past an opening in a wall outside a large compound-looking building, only to see a man in camoflage pass by carrying a long sniper rifle. That was a bit offputing. On another day, I biked & hiked to the top of Cave Hill, for a view of the entire city, and nearly lost my drone to the wind. Northern Ireland was gorgeous, and the green rolling landscapes are a must see.<br><br>
            I also had to switch my hostel for the last day of my stay. This was because I had previously booked the first hostel on Orangman's Day - a holiday-of-sorts in Belfast - and they were closed for the holiday. What I didn't know, but later found out, was that Orangeman's day is a "holiday" where they "celebrate" the historical and political turmoil between catholics and protestants. To commemorate the dispute, crowds are known to build giant pyres of pallettes, and set them afire in the streets. Many locals leave Belfast for Orangeman's day, for their own safety, and the safety of their families.<br><br>
            As I walked to the airport in the early morning of Orangman's day, I walked by several pyres being lit, and even got some strange looks. Needless to say, I quickened my pace, eager to get on the plane, and happy to have seen this beautiful, breathtaking country, and to have escaped it with my breath still intact.
