            Lauterbrunnen, Switzerland - maybe the most beautiful stop on my journey. Switzerland is so cool! Expensive? Yes. Worth it? Definitely! And I only spent time in one small town. I got to take an incredible hike atop the edge of the valley and then the next day, I took a tram to the top of Europe (the highest point in all of Europe), and a tram to the top of the other side of the valley in the evening. In fact, by the time I got back to my room that night, I was experiencing a bit of altitude sickness. But I wouldn't trade it for the world. I will definitely be making my way back to Switzerland to see more, experience more, adventure more.
