            Berlin, Germany - The homeland of my bretheren. I have German heritage, but the main reason for my stay in Germany was to meet up with old friends. A few years back, I joined a Team-Handball Club in Portland - Go Sasquatch! The best thing about handball is that it's a blast to play. The next best thing about handball, is that it is widely popular international, which means that the majority of my teammates are from other countries. Joining this team is actually the main reason I got the itch to travel in the first place, as it gave me a brief look into other cultures. On my handball team, I met some amazing people - three living in Germany now - including one who has become one of my best friends. <br><br> I flew from London into Berlin, where I would be staying with my friend Sebastian. He lives in a subburb condo with his girlfriend. While in Berlin, our friends Mario (from Colonge) and Linda (from Hamburg) came to spend time with us. We explored the city, went swimming, visited the Berlin Wall, did a drone shoot at an old, abandoned NSA tower, and even got stuck in some body of water trying to sail (we lost our wind after getting pretty far out to sea). It was so nice to see familiar faces along the way, and to spend my birthday with my friends. I hope I can make it back soon to see more of the country.
