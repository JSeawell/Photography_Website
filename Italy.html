        <p>If I'm being honest, Italy was one of my least favorite countries. It's just so dirty! It wasn't all bad though. I've been wanting to visit Venice and Rome since I was a kid, so how could I resist when given the opportunity. The drive from Innsbruck to Venice was THE most beautiful drive I've ever taken, and I wish I hadn't been on a non-stop bus trip, and could have stopped for photos and adventures.<br><br>
        Venice was a city I've wanted to visit for ages. A place of magic, in my mind. Unfortunately, it was very underwhelming. In the middle of summer, Venice was a tourist breeding ground, and I don't do well in large crouds. The city was hot, and bustling with crowds, and pretty dirty. I'm glad I went, but I don't have a desire to go back anytime soon.<br><br>
        Rome was next on the route. Roman architecture is awesome - and one of those bucket-list items - and Sebastian and his friend came down from Germany to explore with me. We also met up with some friends I had met previously in Dublin, Charlotte and Liz. We stayed in a pretty cool AirBnb, with a private rooftop.<br><br>
        My last stop in Italy was in Florence. This was one of my shortest stops, as I was only staying for the night. With that said, I went on a short city tour, went out with those in my BusAbout group, and did some laundry. I would have liked to have seen more of the Tuscan hillside landscapes, but by this point Italy was starting to wear on me. I would like to go back to Italy again to see more of the mountains and nature.
