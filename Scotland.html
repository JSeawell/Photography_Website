        <p>I was really excited for Scotland, but didn't really have a reason to be. Braveheart maybe? I had originally planned on spending 3 days in Scotland, but decided on 4 at the last minute. And I'm so glad I did! Edinburgh, Scotland was my favorite city on my trip. The city was beautiful, with amazing architecture and incredible history. But I'm not really a city guy...And yet, within walking distance of the town was Arthur's seat, and some gorgeous hikes. <br><br>
        The castles, the kelpies, and Iron Bru (my new favorite soda). Not only that, but the hostel where I stayed was unbelievable, and I made some unforgettable friends. I spend most of my time in Edinburgh with Conor (from Melbourne, "Straya"), and MacKayla and Taylor (from Minnesota), and hopefully someday we all cross paths again. My biggest regret was not exploring more of the highlands (I took a tour that stopped just short), and I will definitely be returning to do just that. I got my eye on the isle of skye.
