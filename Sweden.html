        <p>Stockholm, Sweden - the beginning of the journey. Besides my brief layover in a stormy Iceland, Sweden was my first stop. My trip would begin and end in Stockholm because I have family living there, and staying with them to bood-end my trip gave me a bit of comfort on this otherwise scary endeavor. At the airport, my aunt picked me up, and we caught-up on the way to their house. While in Sweden, I spent the majority of my time at my family's house, or exploring the beautiful city of Stockholm. We also left Stockholm and travelled by car to Uddevalla, where they have a lake-side summer home. I spent the time playing with my cousins, working out, and getting up early for sunrise drone shoots.<br><br>
        At the end of my trip, I returned to Stockholm as my final pit-stop before a stop-over in Iceland. At this point, I was so burnt-out on all the travelling, that it was really nice to just relax for a few days. Sweden was an incredible country, and I would love to return to explore more of the northern landscape. So much thanks and love to my family for having and supporting me :)
