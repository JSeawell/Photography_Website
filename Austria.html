        <p>Innsbruck Austria was the first stop on my BusAbout journey.
        When we arrived by bus, the skies were dark and foreboding, and
        the beautiful Austrian Alps were nowhere to be seen. I was so
        bummed, and I worried that in my short time in Innsbruck, I would
        miss all the beauty I had hoped for. <br><br>
        
        Thankfully, I couldn't have
        been more wrong. I woke up the next moring to sun pouring through
        the window shutters, and I hurried outside. As I looked around, I
        felt dwarfed by the towering Appalachians. What a sight. In the 
        couple of days I spent in Innsbruck, I was able to walk the 
        outskirts of the city, and then take a tram up the side of the
        giant mountains. The views at the top were out of this world. They did
        not look real. I even feel like my photographs look fake, and while
        they are true to life, they hardly capture the awe.</p>
