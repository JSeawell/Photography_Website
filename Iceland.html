            The land of fire and ice. If I can give you one piece of advice: before you die, you need to visit Iceland. This was my favorite country, hands down. In Iceland, you feel like you are living on another planet, and everywhere you look is something you have never seen before. I rented a car, and I roadtripped to see as many incredible places as I could find, and I had the time of my life. I'll show you. If I could only return to one of the places I visited on my trip, I would choose Iceland, and I don't think I would ever run out of things to see. I can't wait to return.
