        <p>Dublin Ireland was the first destination I explored on my own. I was nervous, but I had a blast. In Dublin, I quickly made friends with some people I met in my Hostel. We explored the city together, went out for dinner and drinks, and went on a few pub crawls. I also took a day-trip from Dublin to the Cliffs of Moher. This was my only opportunity to fly my drone. As soon as I got to the cliffs, I found a private area to launch, but as soon as I got the drone up in the air, a security officer found me and instructed me to take it down. I was super bummed, and I think he could tell, because he went on to tell me that if I walked far enough along the cliffs, I would technically be out of his juristiction. That was a bro-move.<br><br>
        I did as the man suggested, and got some cool photos and drone shots of the cliffs. As I was flying, seaguls began to circle my drone, and even dive towards it. At one point, a guy came up to me and informed me that he had been flying his drone earlier as well, and that the birds almost took his drone out of the sky. I quickly got my shots, and pulled it in to escape the evil gulls. Ireland is such a beautiful country, and I would gladly come back to explore more of the landscape. The cliffs of Slieve League are on my list of destinations to visit in the future.
