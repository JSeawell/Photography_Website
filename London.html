        <p>Oh London. For some reason, London was a bit underwhelming. The women were beautiful ,and the accents were sexy, but for some reason I didn't have the time I had hoped for. Maybe it was partly because of the weather - overcast skies ruined my sunset shoot, and a thunderstorm hit on the morning of my departure - or maybe it was because I didn't make any friends while there. Either way, I did have one really nice day in the city, when I walked the River Thames and got some awesome city architecture shots. <br><br>
        London is a cool city, and I wouldn't mind living there if I were to get a job in the city, but I'd really like to return to explore more of the nearby landscapes. Maybe you've noticed a pattern.
